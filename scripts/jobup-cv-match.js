/**
 * Standalone script (spawned as a child process by routes/api.js), run once per requested job
 * index — in parallel, batched (see routes/api.js) — that picks the jobIndex-th job on an
 * already-known jobup.ch results page, reads (or runs, if not already run before) the AI
 * CV-match analysis for it, and reports the analysis text.
 *
 * This used to also handle login and the job search itself; that's now scripts/jobup-search.js,
 * run once per POST /api/cv-match request before any of these per-job workers are spawned — see
 * its own header comment and CLAUDE.md's "jobup.ch CV-match automation" section for the full
 * split and why. This file picks up exactly where that one left off: an already-resolved results
 * URL (with any search term/location filtering already applied) and a saved Playwright
 * `storageState` file (cookies + localStorage) so this worker's own fresh browser starts already
 * logged in, without repeating the login UI flow.
 *
 * Reads `resultsUrl`, `storageStatePath`, and the 1-based job index to select from
 * `process.argv[2..4]`, and the save/apply job filters from `process.argv[5..7]`
 * (`[resultsUrl, storageStatePath, jobIndex, saveJob, easyApply, ignoreYellowMeter]`). If the
 * index is not a positive integer (errorMessage: "Job index must be a positive integer") or
 * exceeds the number of jobs actually found on its target page (errorMessage: "Job index must
 * not be greater than the number of jobs found on that page"), returns success: false without
 * attempting an analysis. jobup.ch paginates results at JOBS_PER_PAGE (20) per page, so an index
 * beyond the first page navigates there first — see the pagination gotcha in this file's own
 * comments below for how, and its one still-unverified piece. Once the analysis text is
 * available, POSTs it as { analysis, meter, criteria } to `${BACKEND_URL}/api/cv-analysis`
 * (BACKEND_URL defaults to http://localhost:3000) before dismissing the result dialog. `meter`
 * ({ color: 'green'|'yellow'| null, percent: number|null }) and `criteria`
 * ([{ text: string, status: 'green'|'yellow'|'gray' }]) are read straight from the DOM (icon/fill
 * color, not text) via extractAnalysisStructure() — see its comment for how, since none of that
 * survives a plain innerText() read. Prints a single JSON line to stdout:
 * {"jobIndex": number, "success": true|false, "analysis": string|null, "meter": object|null,
 * "criteria": array, "jobUrl": string|null, "errorMessage": string|null,
 * "applicationUrl": string|null}. `jobUrl` is the selected job's own detail-page URL
 * (https://www.jobup.ch/fr/emplois/detail/...), read from the job link's `href` before clicking
 * it — jobup.ch renders the job detail in place rather than navigating there, so the browser's own
 * URL after the click is still the search results page, not the job. `errorMessage` is non-null
 * only for the two specific, expected failures above, meant to be shown to the user as-is (or, for
 * the "not greater than" one specifically, used by routes/api.js to decide whether an
 * out-of-range job index should fail the whole request — the Start of the range — or just be
 * silently dropped from the results — every other index in the range); `null` on every other path,
 * including genuinely unexpected errors.
 *
 * If the analysis's meter is present at all (green *or* yellow — only its absence, the "Vos
 * talents correspondent mieux à d'autres opportunités" heading, skips this outright),
 * prepareJobApplicationDraft() saves the job ("Sauvegarder") when `saveJob` is true and, when
 * `easyApply` is true and "Candidature simplifiée"/"Continuer ma candidature" is available on the
 * job page, opens it — in a new tab, handled via the same BrowserContext.waitForEvent('page'), no
 * separate script/browser needed — and prepares (never submits) a draft application there:
 * generates a cover letter via "Générer" if the field is required and empty, attaches
 * REQUIRED_DOCUMENT_NAMES from the profile if not already present, answers every yes/no question
 * "Oui", then clicks "Sauvegarder" on the application itself. `ignoreYellowMeter`, when true,
 * additionally skips both actions entirely for a yellow meter (only green then qualifies); when
 * false (the default), both green and yellow are treated the same. `saveJob`/`easyApply` gate
 * their two actions independently — either, both, or neither can be enabled. `applicationUrl` is
 * that opened draft application page's own URL (e.g.
 * https://www.jobup.ch/fr/application/create/<uuid>/), captured right after the new tab loads, so
 * the caller can link straight back to the in-progress draft — `null` whenever no draft page was
 * ever opened (easyApply off, no meter, no applicable button, an error, etc.), same convention as
 * `jobUrl`. None of this — nor the meter/criteria extraction it depends on — has been verified
 * against the live site (no jobup.ch session was available in this environment); a failure here is
 * logged and swallowed rather than failing the run, since the analysis itself already succeeded by
 * that point. Diagnostic output goes to stderr so stdout stays parseable.
